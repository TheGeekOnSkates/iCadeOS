// This will be a wrapper around localStorage; here's how I envision this working:
// It'll use 127 bytes, more than enough for a top 10 high score list (even with 8-char names instead of initials), with the 128th byte being where you send commands to tell it to load or save
var storage = {
	init: function(ram) {
		
	},
	load: function(ram) {
		
	},
	save: function(ram) {
		
	},
};
